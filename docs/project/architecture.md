# System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the HopeConnect system architecture, explaining the key components, design patterns, and how they interact.

## High-Level Architecture

HopeConnect follows a layered architecture pattern, which separates concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable and testable. The main layers are:

```

## Key Components

### 1. API Gateway (Express.js)

The API gateway is the entry point for all client requests. It's implemented using Express.js and handles:

- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Error handling

### 2. Routes Layer

The routes layer defines the API endpoints and connects them to the appropriate service methods. It's responsible for:

- Defining API endpoints
- Extracting and validating request parameters
- Calling the appropriate service methods
- Formatting responses

### 3. Services Layer

The services layer contains the business logic of the application. It's responsible for:

- Implementing business rules
- Coordinating operations across multiple models
- Handling transactions
- Performing data validation
- Managing complex operations

### 4. Models Layer

The models layer represents the data structures and handles database interactions. It's implemented using Sequelize ORM and is responsible for:

- Defining data schemas
- Handling database operations (CRUD)
- Defining relationships between entities
- Data validation

### 5. Data Storage (MySQL)

MySQL is used as the primary data storage solution. It stores all application data in a relational database.

## Design Patterns

HopeConnect implements several design patterns to ensure code quality and maintainability:

### MVC Pattern (Modified)

The application follows a modified Model-View-Controller pattern:

- **Models**: Sequelize models represent the data structure
- **Views**: Not applicable in a pure API application
- **Controllers**: Split between routes and services

### Repository Pattern

The models act as repositories, encapsulating the data access logic and providing a clean API for the services layer.

### Middleware Pattern

Express middleware is used extensively to handle cross-cutting concerns such as:

- Authentication
- Logging
- Error handling
- Request validation

### Dependency Injection

Services are injected into routes, allowing for better testability and loose coupling.

## Authentication and Authorization

HopeConnect uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication:

1. Users authenticate by providing credentials
2. The server validates credentials and issues a JWT
3. Clients include the JWT in subsequent requests
4. Middleware validates the JWT and extracts user information
5. Role-based access control determines if the user can access the requested resource

## Error Handling

The application implements a centralized error handling mechanism:

1. Domain-specific errors are thrown in services
2. A global error handler middleware catches all errors
3. Errors are logged and appropriate HTTP responses are sent to clients
4. In development mode, detailed error information is included in responses

## Data Flow

A typical request flows through the system as follows:

1. Client sends a request to an API endpoint
2. Express middleware processes the request (authentication, validation, etc.)
3. The route handler extracts parameters and calls the appropriate service
4. The service implements business logic and interacts with models
5. Models perform database operations
6. Results flow back through the service and route layers
7. The response is formatted and sent back to the client

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through:

- Stateless design (no session state stored on the server)
- Database connection pooling
- Separation of concerns allowing for microservice extraction if needed

## Security Measures

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT for authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Helmet middleware for HTTP header security
